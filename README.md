Hi, I’m @MRS-Joe, I’m *interested* in <b>game development</b>, from <b>programming</b>, to <b>story writing</b>, <b>music</b>, and even <b>graphic design</b>. I’m *currently learning* <b>Python</b>,
using <b>Processing</b> in my <b>Comp-Sci 30</b> class. *Currently*, there <b>isn't anything</b> particular I'm <b>looking to work on</b> outside of class right now. If you want to *contact me*,
I would try <b>Twitter</b>. My <b>@</b> should be in my <b>bio</b>.<br>
<b>*WARNING*</b>, I have no idea if, or how, I get notifications for things like DMs and @'s on Twitter, so that's that.
